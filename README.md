# UITM Sport Facility Reservation Web Application

To develop a sport facility reservation system for the UITM students that allows them to reserve the facility for their use.

# Background
The current sports facility reservation system at Universiti Teknologi MARA (UITM) is characterized by inefficiencies, lack of transparency, and accessibility issues. Users experience long waiting times, difficulties accessing real-time information about sports facility availability, and occasional server downtimes that impede the overall user experience. With the increasing number of UITM students year by year, the current system cannot systematically hold the reservation. To address these challenges, the project aims to design and develop an improved system that streamlines the booking process, provides clear and up-to-date information on facility availability, and creates a user-friendly and accessible platform. The objective is to enhance the overall sports experience for the UITM community by addressing the identified inefficiencies and improving the usability, security, and efficiency of the sports facility booking system
